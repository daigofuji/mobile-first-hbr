# **EMBRACE THE FLUIDITY OF THE WEB!**

Instead of page-based designs, we need **design systems**.

# Atomic Web Design

---
class: middle, center
### **Atomic Web Design**
[http://patternlab.io/about.html](http://patternlab.io/about.html)

![img](img/atomic-web-design.gif)

Created by **Brad Frost**, the creator of [this is responsive](http://bradfrost.github.io/this-is-responsive/) pattern library and [Mobile Web Best Practice](http://mobilewebbestpractices.com/)

---
class: middle

![img](img/atomic-web-design.gif)

**Atoms** on the Web are HTML elements like: h1, p, div, button, etc. More abstract atoms include colors and fonts. 

Combining atoms, you get **molecules**, molecules create **organisms**.

---
class: middle

![img](img/atomic-web-design.gif)

## Each of them is **on its own, responsive**. 

---
class: middle

![img](img/atomic-web-design.gif)

Think of molecules and organisms as **Lego-like building blocks** designed to be combined together.

Combined, they become **templates**, and ultimately **pages**. 

---
class: center, middle
## Every reusable components on our website is now created with **“mobile first”** in mind. 

---
class: center, middle, inverse

# Pattern Lab
---
class: center, middle

### Pattern Lab is an open source tool to help you create atomic design systems.
![img](img/pattern-lab.png)
**[http://patternlab.io/](http://patternlab.io/)**

Also created by Brad Frost, maintained by Dave Olsen on [github](https://github.com/pattern-lab/patternlab-php)

---
class: middle
## What did Pattern-Lab give us?

- Visual library of building blocks
- View-port resizer and tester
- Annotation and Code viewer

## Tool to create your site’s “living” **front-end style guide**
---
class: center, middle, inverse

# Front end Style Guide

---
class: middle

### A browser-based web front-end style guide, an interface inventory, or pattern library, can help us with:
* Design Consistency
* Code Standards (i.e. html structure, css class names)
* Responsive Web Design

---
class: middle

### Benefits of a front-end style guide

* Being able to test responsive design ("Where does this design break?")
* Improved workflow (Feedback / collaboration "Designing/deciding in the browser.")
* Shared vocabulary (Design/Tech/Edit "What do you call this building block?")
* Future reference ("What's available? What needs to be designed/coded next?")

## Examples of front-end style guide
* [StyleGuides.io](http://styleguides.io/)
* [BBC](http://www.bbc.co.uk/gel)
* [Starbucks](http://www.starbucks.com/static/reference/styleguide/)
* [Yelp](http://www.yelp.com/styleguide)

---
class: middle

### Challenges of styleguides
* Time consuming to create
* Seen only as a designer/developer tool
* Often too abstract
* Often too incomplete and/or out-of-date
